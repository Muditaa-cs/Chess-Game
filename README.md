# Chess-Game
Introduction: The project implements a human player against a computer player chess game. The computer player uses alpha-beta pruning in a minimax algorithm to decide on a move. The algorithm only goes to a certain depth and an evaluation function is implemented. The human player is allowed to input any legal moves for his own chess pieces.   

Use of System: To play the game, ChessPlay.java is to be run. The user is asked to type the name of the file input containing the chess board configuration via a scanner (The provided file Board.txt has the usual chess setup). Then he is to choose for the number of plies, then a colour to get its own side. Then there is an input of whether or not to keep the chess board as it is or manually reconfigure it for as much as he would like to. The chess game then starts with the white player. For the human player’s turn, a move can be made as such: if a piece is chosen, its current column number (example a) and row number (example b) are input in this order as an input value (ab). Then, new chosen spot column number and row number are input in this order as another input value on a second line (for example, a white pawn could be moved by typing 12 on the first line, then 13 on the second line). If the human player makes a move that is not legal, a message is output saying ‘Illegal move’ and is offered another chance to make a legal chess move. If the move is legal, a new board is output with the human’s chosen move having been carried out. After a human player’s turn, if the game can still go on, the computer makes a move and a new board will output, after the computer’s move has been made. The captured pieces by a player are kept at the player’s side of the board. The game will keep on going until either a draw or a checkmate or a stalemate or the 50-rule repetition is reached, and the final state of the game will be output. 

To note: if a human player wants to make a castling move (and it is legal), enter the king’s change in position first, the rook will be automatically moved.
